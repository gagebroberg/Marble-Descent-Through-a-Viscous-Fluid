# Marble-Descent-Through-a-Viscous-Fluid
Repo containing Marble Descent project files.

This project uses dimensional analysis to predict the terminal velocity of a marble in a viscous fluid given the following information:
* mass of the marble
* radius of the marble
* density of the fluid
* viscosity of the fluid
* gravitational acceleration
